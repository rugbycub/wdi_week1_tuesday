You want to make scrambled eggs this morning.

Do you...


Use Gordon Ramsey's recipe?
Whip up your own thing?
~p01:c3:p2
Call someone for a for a recipe?
~p01:c4:p3
Go online for a recipe?

~p02
Great idea.  Who should we call?

~p02:c1:p5
Call Mom

~p02:c2:p5
Call your friend 

~p03
The internet has lots of choices.
Where should we look? 

~p03:c1:p8
Food Network Online

~p03:c2:p9
I'll just google it

~p04
Your mom is disappointed that you don't know how to make your own breakfast, and that you only call her to ask for recipes for eggs.  Would it be so hard to stop using that computer for a few minutes to give the woman that raised you a call? its no wonder you cant settle down with any one. can't even make your own eggs. Wny can't you be more like Gordon Ramsey

~p05
You got tied up in a conversation with your friend arguing about the
merits of your recipe vs Gordon's

~p06
Food Network's site has a ton of options.  And if Gordon's recipe is as good as you hear, maybe another TV chef has a good breakfast option

Ina Garten

~p06:c3:p9
Sandra Lee

~p07
You googled scrambled egg recipes and then spent hours watching cat videos.  now you're late!

~p08
Ina Garten's recipe seems pretty good, seeing she only uses good eggs and good butter. Although you Wonder why Jeffrey is never home and why she never leaves the hamptons.  

~p09
Sandra Lee's semi-homemade recipe seems to be for an egg mcmuffin and a big pitcher of vodka, but the tablescape she designed would be lovely.  You still wonder how she ended up first lady of New York, but maybe its the vodka talking.
